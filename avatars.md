We work on overcoming the limitiations of classical computer graphics approaches 
in order to create easy to use algorithm for creating photorealistic human avatars.
We combine deep learning methods for image synthesis and rendering with insights from
classical computer graphics and computer vision in order to create state-of-the-art human avatars.
