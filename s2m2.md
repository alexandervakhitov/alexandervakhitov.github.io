In 2016-2017 we created a web-based system for image retrieval for arbitrary image categories. We were motivated
by an imaginary situtation when a robot explores the unknown environment and colelcts a  set of images of the objects which
it met on the way, and needs an ability to perform image retrieval in this image collection. Our system was based on a meta-learning
algorithm which 'learning to learn' probabilistic models of arbitrary visual concepts in the space of image embeddings.

Here is a video describing the method and the system:
