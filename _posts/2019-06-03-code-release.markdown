I added a page on the *Learnable line descriptor* system we developed last year with [Victor Lempitsky](http://sites.skoltech.ru/compvision/members/vilem/). 
It is a step forward compared to the well-known [ORB-SLAM2](https://github.com/raulmur/ORB_SLAM2) system by Mur et al. By learning the line descriptor 
and introducing line detection and matching into the stereo SLAM pipeline we increase accuracy and robustness of the system 
compared to the baseline ORB-SLAM2. Please check the page [here](/lld/).
